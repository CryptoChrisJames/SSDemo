# SoundSelect
This is the source code for Sound Select, a full 
custom web application for booking studio time with engineers at 
their personal studios. This application was developed in ASP.Net Core and a bit of JQuery.
Users are able to signup and create a custom profile, and then either 
list a studio for booking or book time at a studio that they choose. The program uses Entity Framework Core 
and SQL server for database nad migration management. 
It uses HTML, CSS, Twitter Bootstrap and Jquery for front end interaction.
